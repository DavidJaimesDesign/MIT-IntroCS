####Recap on last week
* variable types ints, floats, doubles

#Branching and Iteration
####Outline:
    1. Strings
    2. Iteration
    3. Brancing

##Strings
* letters, special characters, spaces, digits

###Concatenation
* you can use + to combine the strings

###Star operator
* you can multiply the number of strings 3 * hello = hello hello hello

###Naunces about print()

* you have to cast to a string str(variable)
* you can also use commas inside of print they automatically add a space

###Getting input from the user

* Everything the user types in becomes a string and it is bound to a variable
* you can then cast the string to other types typically for math stuff
* you have to explicitly cast 

###Comparators YAY

>, >= , < , =>, ==, != equalities

ints to ints
floats to ints

strings to strings :D

* you can also use (not, and, or) syntax for python
* > then in strings checks for alphabeticall order which is cool for a sorting algo

##Branching

* imagine going through a maze
* if you put your right hand on a wall and continue you can solve the maze
* you can build the descisions into the computer

###if statement
* will evaluate to either true or false
###elif statement
* lets you make switch case branching

##Iteration

###while loop

* do thing in loop
* check condition
* if condition still true
* do block
* if false stop the loop

* FUN thing try using the code expansion for the loops

* make sure to initialize the counter variable
* iterate the counter

### for loop 
* for some loop variable in range do 
* it is some what constraining

to customize range:
    * need to give it a stop
    * range(start, stop, step)
    * only 1 value it is the stop
    * step is 1 by default but that can be changed

###Look at the example codes for some information
